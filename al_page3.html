          <h3>Some writings for each painting that I never finished</h3>
          <h2>Mock Suns by Angela Lane</h2>
          <p>The color world in Mock Suns is very nuanced and based in green, red, and blue. This painting is also very simple with 
            large washes of color built on top of each other. Lane takes inspiration from historical space illustrations. Her work is 
            almost like in the way Jenna Gribbon paints with layers of thin paint to build up dimensional color worlds. I am also enamored 
            with her intuitive use of historical celestial illustrations and how she reconfigures them to her own determinations as she fills
             the sky here with more suns than exist.
          </p>
          <h2>Ophelia by Oda Iselin Sønderland</h2>
          <p>
            Sønderland's works take on a very illustrative quality reflective of the content and symbolism generated from her unconscious. 
            This specific painting, Ophelia,  is influenced obviously by Hamlet and the story of Ophelia, though that isn't immediately 
            evident through the imagery. Sønderland generally subverts mythology and unconscious collective symbolism into her own personal 
            meanings to derive her work from. Themes of transformation and renewal are present here as the reflection of the tree becomes a 
            nymph and the car is symbolic of the body drowning, only to be reborn. This work is so simple, but conveys a fully-fledged story, 
            meditated through large swaths of color and delicate, crisp lines.
          </p>
          <h2>Two Follows of Cadmus Devoured by a Dragon by Cornelius Van Haarlem</h2>
          <p>
            The paint follows the major players of this work around in an almost circular format, with the the dragon biting the head of one 
            follower and digging its claw into the other follower, while the other follower's legs become substitute for the first as he is 
            sprawled over him. The circle is repeated in the background as an opening to a field shows another potential follower bringing down 
            another dragon. This work is also simple, yet evocative with high level of detail and thick paint on focal points. The color world 
            is fairly bland, but has a few high moments with the blue, green, and red. The red of the mouth of the dragon and the blood is very
            pronounced in contrast to these other elements.
